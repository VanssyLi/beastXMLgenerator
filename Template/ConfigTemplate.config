Short description here...


----------------------------------
## Alignment
# Full path to the multiple sequence alignment file.

alignment = "{alignment}.fasta"

----------------------------------
## Metadata
# Path to the metadata table (use the provided template).
#
# Required columns:
# - Sample_ID: Sample identifier.
# - Species: Species of the sample. At least one outgroup sequence is required,
#            since the pipeline uses divergence between sister species and your species as calibration.
# - Origin: General locality information of the sample. Not used in the pipeline,
#           but strongly recommended for reference.
# - Calibrated_yBP: Calibrated radiocarbon age (in years BP).
#   - Use "ND" if the age is infinite or not available.
#   - Use "0" for modern samples.
#   - The pipeline relies on C14 ages as calibrations, so include as many as possible.
# - Calibrated_yBP_uncertainty: Uncertainty of the calibrated age (for reference only).
# - TipDating: Use "Y" to include the sample in tip dating, or "N" to exclude it.

metadata = "{alignment}.Meta.xlsx"

----------------------------------
## Single Dating or Joint Dating
# - Single Dating: generates one XML per sample.
# - Joint Dating: generates one XML for all samples combined.
# - Tip-dated samples are specified in the metadata ("TipDating" column).
# - Default: Single Dating.

Single_Dating = True

----------------------------------
## Tip-dating Priors
# Path to the tip-dating priors table (use the provided template).
#
# Required columns:
# - date: Approximate sample age, used as MCMC starting point (does not affect results).
# - prior: Prior distribution type. Options: uniform (default), lognormal, normal.
# - mu/lower: Parameter for the distribution.
#             (mu for lognormal; lower bound for uniform).
# - sigma/upper: Parameter for the distribution.
#                (sigma for lognormal; upper bound for normal).
# - offset: Offset of the distribution (default = 0).

tip_priors = "{alignment}.TipPriors.csv"

----------------------------------
## Population Model
# Currently only "skygrid" is supported.

population_model = "skygrid"

----------------------------------
## Clock Model
# Currently only "strict" is supported.

clock_model = "strict"

----------------------------------
## Taxon Set & Tip-dated Samples
# - Settings ("Group-By", "TipDating") are read from metadata.
# - No need to modify here.

----------------------------------
## Partitions
# Default = disabled.
# If enabled, provide an annotation file in GFF format.

split_partition = False
# annotation = "{reference}.gff3"   # remove hash at the begining of the line if split_partition = True

----------------------------------
## Substitution Model
# Available options: HKY, GTR (others under development).
# Optional parameters: Gamma (G), Invariant sites (I).
# Examples: HKY+G, HKY+G+I, GTR+G, GTR+I.
#
# If partitions are NOT used:
subs_model = "HKY+G"

# If partitions ARE used:
# - Each partition specified here must also be present in the annotation file.
# - Uncomment the line below, and comment out the "subs_model" above.
# subs_model = "tRNA:HKY+G+I, rRNA:HKY+G+I, CDS:HKY+G+I, D_loop:HKY+G"

----------------------------------
## Root Calibration (TMRCA)
# Outgroup divergence time is used as calibration (lognormal distribution).

root_height_mean   = "1650000"   # numeric
root_height_stdev  = "500000"    # numeric
root_height_offset = "0"         # default = 0

----------------------------------
## MCMC Chain
# MCMC length and logging frequency.

chainLength = "100000000"    # numeric
log_every   = "10000"        # numeric

outdir = "{out_path}"
